# Naive-Bayes-Algorithm
Implementation of the basic Naive Bayes algorithm

Funcionalities:

Added functionality: prevention of the underflow issues by using logarithmic transformation.

Added functionality: implementation of the additive smoothing for probability estimation in the model, allowing the user to specify the strength of smoothing as an input parameter.

Added functionality: enabling the algorithm to work with numerical input attributes by modeling the conditional distribution of the attributes with a normal distribution.
